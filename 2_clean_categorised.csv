To investigate Hypothesis 6, a series of mixed ANOVAs was conducted to examine the interactions between shyness and difficulty in predicting flow experience (physiological activity). Crucially, we observed a significant two-way interaction between shyness and difficulty in predicting HR [F(2,34) = 4.56, p < 0.05, Œ<U+2211>p2 = 0.23]. Simple main effect analysis revealed that the shy participants had a higher HR than the non-shy participants under the medium [M = 78.78, SEM = 3.14 vs. M = 77.53, SEM = 3.10; F(2,17) = 4.31, p < 0.01] and difficult conditions [M = 79.29, SEM = 3.12 vs. M = 77.84, SEM = 3.23; F(2,17)",Results,2,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01121,Frontiers in Psychology,Front Psychol,Physiological Signal Analysis for Evaluating Flow during Playing of Computer Games of Varying Difficulty,NA,8,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/oai/oai.cgi?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:pubmedcentral.nih.gov:5495833&metadataPrefix=pmc,2017
